This folder contains my basketball data analysis escapades. In it you will find webscraping, graphing/data visualization, python code, and hopefully something useful or insightful. 

Right now I have two projects:

- Adding Combine information into a dataframe with toher basic stats for later use in machine learning stuff

- Creating new metrics about shot distance data and true shooting by location.
